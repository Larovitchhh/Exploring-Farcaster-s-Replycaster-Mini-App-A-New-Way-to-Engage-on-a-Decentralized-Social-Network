While Replycaster offers exciting possibilities, it operates within Farcaster’s storage constraints. Users are limited to 5,000 casts, 2,500 reactions, and other message types per storage unit, with older messages pruned if limits are exceeded. Replycaster’s replies likely count toward this cast limit, meaning users must manage their storage or purchase additional units to maintain their activity. Additionally, while Farcaster’s timestamp system (based on a Jan 1, 2021 epoch) allows for flexible posting, replies cannot be timestamped more than 15 minutes into the future, ensuring real-time relevance.
